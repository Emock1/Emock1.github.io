  <br>This article was geared towards providing tips and strategies for managing the transition into college life for new students to the university. This is a project I concieved and produced myself from start to end. I wanted a web story that was more student-oriented and that would provide useful information. The process for this project included interviewing the two professors quoted and two first-year students. I wrote this article and it was edited by my supervisor Luisa Buttler.</br></p></section>

  <br>This article covered a collaboration between the university, the Smithsonian's Marine Global Earth Observatory, and the University of Texas Marine Science Institute on an event called a Bioblitz. In this web story, I chose to focus on the collaborations mentioned in the story. I also wanted to show how this event was an amazing opportunity for students to be exposed to national experts in their field. I conducted email interviews with the professor and student quoted in the story. I wrote this article and it was edited by my supervisor Luisa Buttler.</br></p></section>

  <br>This article was about a group of Master of Public Administration (MPA) students who, as part of their capstone project, met with and interviewed youths from Rockport High School to understand their concerns for the city after being hit by Hurricane Harvey. It heavily featured university students who, through their education, made a direct impact on a hurricane-ravaged community. I was provided already written testimonials from MPA student participants, along with the forms and presentations they used in their work. I integrated all this into the story. I wrote this article and it was edited by my supervisor Luisa Buttler.</br></p></section>

  <br>The process for this web story included interviewing the professor in person and attended a talk explaining the subject matter of his book. I utilized multiple research participant quotes that were provided to us by the professor (still ensuring their anonymity). I wrote this article and my supervisor Luisa Buttler did the copy editing.</br></p></section>

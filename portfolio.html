  <br>This is a project I concieved and produced during my time as Graduate Assistant at the Office of Marketing and Communications at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. I wanted a web story that was more student-oriented and that would provide useful information. The process for this project included interviewing the two professors quoted and two first-year students. I wrote the story and it was edited by my supervisor Luisa Buttler.</br></p></section>
